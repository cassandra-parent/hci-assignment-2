## The Problem
Inclusive and accessible design is aimed to accomodate the diverse abilities of people<sup>[1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142694X1730087X)</sup>. There are many reasons that traditional technology may not be inclusive of people with disabilities including complicated instructions, lack of visual aides, and inconsistent navigation <sup>[2](https://content.iospress.com/articles/technology-and-disability/tad00242)</sup>. Despite simple technology changes being transformative for disadvantaged communities, mainstream personal technologies still largely remain inaccessible <sup>[3](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3178855?casa_token=fCefw1GO1d0AAAAA:aDsxFfi060wTbTZ1LabQdP_dUklkE7ILuYbwNMQba8xhFRWrnvN7gDdkmFqt3EytKJdw5VTDDOye2w)</sup>. OFtentimes, these mainstream designers will do the bare minimum to satisfy the legal requirements for accessibility<sup>[3](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3178855?casa_token=fCefw1GO1d0AAAAA:aDsxFfi060wTbTZ1LabQdP_dUklkE7ILuYbwNMQba8xhFRWrnvN7gDdkmFqt3EytKJdw5VTDDOye2w)</sup>. 

However, the following video discusses how accessible design is not only extremely beneficial for users, but also greatly expands user bases of technologies. As the video explains, with one in five people having some sort of disability, having accessible design is essential for success.

## Development

When developing accessible technology, it is important to consider that a wide range of disabilities exist, and that different disabilities could come with different needs <sup>[4](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233608298_Conducting_Usability_Studies_with_Users_Who_Are_Elderly_or_Have_Disabilities)</sup>. Conducting usabilitiy studies with people who have a wide range of abilities is one of the best ways to ensure that your design is inclusive and accessible <sup>[4](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233608298_Conducting_Usability_Studies_with_Users_Who_Are_Elderly_or_Have_Disabilities)</sup>
. Click [here](https://a11yrules.com/series/a11y-rules-soundbite/) to listen to a variety of short podcasts where disabled users talk about their diverse challenges when interacting with online technologies.

In addition, adding diverse users to your development team can allow for a more holistic perspective to be incorporated into the final design.

## Implementation
While there are a broad range of diabilities, there are a few simple things you can do to make your designs more accessible <sup>[2](https://content.iospress.com/articles/technology-and-disability/tad00242)</sup>. For instance, you can increase the contrast in your designs so people with visual impairments can better understand your content.

Another thing that could help individuals with visual impairments is the not just using color to indicate a task. Adding text or symbol descriptions can make these features more accessible.

People with audio impairments have different needs. For them, adding a transcript option or closed captioning on a video can be really beneficial.

Keep in mind that these changes also benefit users without disabilities: if you're watching a video in a loud setting, maybe you'll turn on the captions for your own understanding. In this way, accessibility also links to universal design which integrates accessible technologies into daily life <sup>[3](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3178855?casa_token=fCefw1GO1d0AAAAA:aDsxFfi060wTbTZ1LabQdP_dUklkE7ILuYbwNMQba8xhFRWrnvN7gDdkmFqt3EytKJdw5VTDDOye2w)</sup>.

## Designing for Joy
While integrating accessible technology into essential web services is great, it is also important to look beyond traditional accessibility applications <sup>[5](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-20916-6_38)</sup>. This is because while accessible technology is becoming more prevalent in essential web services, there still are very few accessible technologies designed for recreational use <sup>[5](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-20916-6_38)</sup>. 

Video games are enjoyed as creative, emotional, and social outlets for many <sup>[6](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-23560-4_22)</sup>. However, for a growing number of people with disabilities and/or those acquiring disabilities due to age-related decline, this kind of media is becoming inaccessible <sup>[6](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-23560-4_22)</sup>.

## Improvement
While these tips and resources are great to get start in accessible design, as a designer, it is important to continue to learn about accessibility and how it can best be achieved. [Here](https://www.a11yproject.com/resources/) is a compilation of resources including books, software packages, conferences, and more that are all about accessible design. By continuing to educate ourselves, we can become better and more inclusive designers.
