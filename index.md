## The Problem
Inclusive and accessible design is aimed to accomodate the diverse abilities of people<sup>[1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142694X1730087X)</sup>. There are many reasons that traditional technology may not be inclusive of people with disabilities including complicated instructions, lack of visual aides, and inconsistent navigation <sup>[2](https://content.iospress.com/articles/technology-and-disability/tad00242)</sup>. Despite simple technology changes being transformative for disadvantaged communities, mainstream personal technologies still largely remain inaccessible <sup>[3](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3178855?casa_token=fCefw1GO1d0AAAAA:aDsxFfi060wTbTZ1LabQdP_dUklkE7ILuYbwNMQba8xhFRWrnvN7gDdkmFqt3EytKJdw5VTDDOye2w)</sup>. OFtentimes, these mainstream designers will do the bare minimum to satisfy the legal requirements for accessibility<sup>[3](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3178855?casa_token=fCefw1GO1d0AAAAA:aDsxFfi060wTbTZ1LabQdP_dUklkE7ILuYbwNMQba8xhFRWrnvN7gDdkmFqt3EytKJdw5VTDDOye2w)</sup>. 

However, the following video discusses how accessible design is not only extremely beneficial for users, but also greatly expands user bases of technologies. As the video explains, with one in five people having some sort of disability, having accessible design is essential for success.

## Development

When developing accessible technology, it is important to consider that a wide range of disabilities exist, and that different disabilities could come with different needs <sup>[4](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233608298_Conducting_Usability_Studies_with_Users_Who_Are_Elderly_or_Have_Disabilities)</sup>. Conducting usabilitiy studies with people who have a wide range of abilities is one of the best ways to ensure that your design is inclusive and accessible <sup>[4](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233608298_Conducting_Usability_Studies_with_Users_Who_Are_Elderly_or_Have_Disabilities)</sup>
. Click [here](https://a11yrules.com/series/a11y-rules-soundbite/) to listen to a variety of short podcasts where disabled users talk about their diverse challenges when interacting with online technologies.

In addition, adding diverse users to your development team can allow for a more holistic perspective to be incorporated into the final design.
